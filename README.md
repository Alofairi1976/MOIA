This Repository contains supplementary files for the project: “Constraint-Based Models for Dominating Protein Interaction Networks” 
The following Repository includes the following matlab functions:
1- MSKMDS_ILP : This function to solve graph minimun dominating set problem by ILP model using Mosek solver form matlab.
2-GRBMDS_ILP:This function to solve graph minimun dominating set problem by ILP model using Gurobi solver form matlab.
3-crds : This function to determine the critical , redundant  and intermittent  nodes using traditional method.
4-GetTwo_MDSets :This Function developed to solve BigMatrix by ILP solver to generate the most two different  minimum dominating sets connect matlab with mosek.
5-Get_MMDSets: This Function developed to solve BigMatrix by ILP solver to generate Multiple minimum dominating sets From the grpah adjacency Matrix.
    % The function also find the critical nodes as the intersection between the first generated Two MDSets.
